# SelfSupervisedLearningForUserLocalization

Background
Indoor positioning is a key enabler for a wide range of applications, including navigation, smart factories and cities, surveillance, security, IoT, and sensor networks. Additionally, indoor position can be leveraged for improved beamforming and channel estimation in wireless communications.

Objective
The object of the competition is to design and train and algorithm that can determine the position of a user, based on estimated channel impulse responses. Moreover improving accuracy by using a semi-supervised learning approach to re-use unlabeld data.
